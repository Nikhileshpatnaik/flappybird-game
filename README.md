ðŸŽ® Flappy Bird Clone (Java)
A desktop version of the classic Flappy Bird game developed using Java and Swing.

This game project showcases my understanding of Java GUI development, game loops, event handling, and collision detection. Built entirely with Java and the Swing library, it includes smooth animations, score tracking, obstacle generation, and real-time keyboard interaction. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of object-oriented programming and Java's graphical capabilities.
